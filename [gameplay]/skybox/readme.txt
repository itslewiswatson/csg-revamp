i have also released a skybox pack at:

Using a high scale LOD object (sphere) to draw (.dds) cubebox on.

Adjust the skybox_scale variable if it seems inappropriate.
Change/disable the weather setting in line 42.
Enable alpha blending in line 24 (if you want to see moon at night)
Invert timecycle in line 26 (if you have a night time skybox)

If there are any suggestions, please leave them in the comment section.
